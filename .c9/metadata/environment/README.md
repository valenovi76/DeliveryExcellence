","","These are the orginal MockUps","________________________________________","## Testing","","User Testing","All pages functions and information was reviewed by colleagues and peers with follow up on their feedback. All the links to social media have","been tested and are live and working, they also do open in a different tab to ensure the site flow is not disrupted .","The link to the company Intranet does work when on company’s connection, it cannot however be open when on a generic connection, ","in line with company’s security policy.","The Submit button, on the contact form, is not connected to any database at the moment, however, the form is built using specific ","input fields for specific set of data (email for email, number for phone number and so on) and the attribute “required” ,ensures ","the correct data is gathered. An error message, alerts the users in case the wrong data is entered, ","achieving two goals: collection of meaningful, clean data for later use and a smooth customer experience.","","Browser Testing","","The site was tested on the following browsers","•\tGoogle Chrome,","•\tMS Internet Explorer,","•\tMS Edge,","•\tMozilla Firefox,","•\tSafari.","","The site was also tested on different devices.","","•\tLaptop,","•\tAndroid Tablet (10 inch),","•\tSamsung Galaxy S7 & S10+,","•\tiPhone & Ipad (Note the testing on Ipad was limited to the inspection on Google Chrome Developer for lack of actual device).","","","Testing the site across the different devices I realised that the index page was not diplaying correctly for Ipad-Pro so I created a mediaquery to cater for that.","I did the same for the About page, since the third column on the right was being moved at the bottom, instead of stacking vertically.","I added a media query also to take care of the portfolio page : for smaller devices the timeline and the icons (purple gears) have been set to display=none.","Same for the method page where the Icons that are visible with an alternating pattern on the page are removed for smaller screens.","All the above choices make for a neater and simpler navigation, less cluttered, when the site is opened on mobiles and tablets.","","In testing the css code i came across Vendor errors.","After some research I realised there is nothing I can do to validate vendor extensions except to not use them. ","The vendor extensions are proprietary code.","","","________________________________________","## Features","","-[index](https://valenovi76.github.io/DeliveryExcellence/index.html)","The page is a \"cover\" for the site. It has a catchy sentence to encourage further navigation and offers the option to Contact the team clicking the Contact Us button","The Button is kept large on smaller devices to make it easier to be clicked. It does redirect the user to the Contact Us page","-[team](https://valenovi76.github.io/DeliveryExcellence/team.html)","The page showcases the team with a brief bio about their professional skills which are further represented with a visual aid : Google graphs","The graphs are responsive on hover and show the relevant skill label and the percentage","-[method](https://valenovi76.github.io/DeliveryExcellence/method.html)","The page explains in a simple and succint way what Lean Six Sigma is all about, accompanying the user thourghout the 5 distincitve phases.","The inspiration was taken from a [Boostrap template] (https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/sparrow-simple-seamless-alive/)","-[portfolio](https://valenovi76.github.io/DeliveryExcellence/portfolio.html)","The page displays a timeline with the projects that have been completed so far. A download icon enables the dowload of the relevant project docs, where available","-[contact](https://valenovi76.github.io/DeliveryExcellence/contact.html)","The page gives few options to the client to get in touch with the team : phisical business addres, phone call (the number is in a phone format allowing a direct call to be dialled directly) and a contact form.","________________________________________","## Technologies","•\tHTML","•\tCSS","•\tBootstrap","•\tFontawesome","•\tGoogle Font","•\tJQuery","•\tGoogle charts","","The site uses Boostrap and Google charts with the relevant Jqueries, to show the skillset of each team member on the About page.","The Jqueries do result in warning on the W3C code validation sites, but since we haven't approached the subject as of yet I did not attempt to amend them.","From a UX point of view they work perfectly fine.","","________________________________________","","## Future-Releases","An email confirming a successful submit should be sent when a form is filled in.","The site will eventually be linked to a back-end database and I would like to tie it in with a team productivity view and a dashboard to track projects requests from “book to bill”.","There should be a login option for team members to control the new requests submitted by the users and to manage them.","","________________________________________","## Deployment","This site is hosted on GitHub and deployed directly from the master branch. Any commit updates or new releases will be deployed to that master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.","To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/valenovi76/DeliveryExcellence into your terminal.
