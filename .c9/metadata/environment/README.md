","We conducted a an internal Voice of the Customer series of meeting and the findings lead us to identify the below business purpose for the site","The team uses lean Six Sigma and Continuous Improvement (CI) tools to advance productivity across the business. The purpose of the site is to promote it as the “place to go” when a structured, data based approach is needed to improve performance, ultimately generating more projects requests.","","Since the above mentioned tools and techniques (Lean Six Sigma and CI) can be quite complicated and cumbersome, the site had to be catchy and fun but at the same time give an idea of professionalism and clarity where the methodology is explained. ","It also had to offer the option to get in touch multiple times, in effort to increase work stream.","2.\tUX","Using Customer Experience Mapping techniques, I created a “customer persona” profile, to identify the site’s audience, their needs, demographic, expectations and so on.","A typical user will be a company employee, seeking to improve the company’s productivity identifying possible issues in their work processes and workflows. ","They will want to understand what the Delivery Excellence team does, how they do it and have few examples of what they achieved so far.","They will need to be able to contact the team easily once they have made up their mind.","","The demographic is quite advanced >50 years age gap.","The site will be internal, so they will expect a continuity with the company intranet “feel”. This will translate in precise guidelines in terms of branding (colours palette, position of logo etc…) and a more old-fashioned architecture with a static, linear display of the site pages. A parallax technique, however trendy, would be out place.
